The dataset consists of 8091 images, stored in the Flicker8k_Dataset folder. Accompanying text files with image captions are located in the Flickr_8k_text folder. The Flickr8k.token file, lists all image names alongside their corresponding captions. 

# Image Caption Generator Model 
Image Caption Generator Model = CNN + LSTM

1. CNN - To extract features from the image.
2. LSTM - To generate a description from the extracted information of the image.
